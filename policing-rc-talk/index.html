<p>
"Without slavery you have no cotton; without cotton you have no modern industry.
It is slavery that has given the colonies their value;
it is the colonies that have created world trade,
and it is world trade that is the pre-condition of large-scale industry.
Thus slavery is an economic category of the greatest importance.
</p>

<p>
Without slavery North America, the most progressive of countries, would be transformed into a patriarchal country.
Wipe out North America from the map of the world, and you will have anarchy —
the complete decay of modern commerce and civilisation.
Cause slavery to disappear and you will have wiped America off the map of nations."

<li>Racism is not caused by ignorance and hence cannot be cured by logic. Racism is about power.</li>

<ul>
<li>London Metropolitan Police: often considered the first professional police force, formed in 1829</li>
<li>Considered more effective than the unprofessional watch or the hated army and militia</li>
<li>Had its origin in the British colonial occupation of Ireland</li>
<li>US police imported this idea, starting from Boston in 1838</li>
<li>but cities like Charleston, SC; Savannah, GA; and New Orleans, LA had full-time police in the 1700s</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section >
<ul>
<li>"They had the power to ride onto private property to insure that slaves were not harboring weapons or fugitives, conducting meetings, or learning to read or write.</li>

</ul>
<p>
They also played a major role in preventing slaves from escaping to the North through regular patrols on rural roads."
</p>
<ul>
<li>"urban patrols became professional as early as the Charleston City Guard and Watch of 1783"</li>
<li>Pennsylvania State Police: mainly for union-busting</li>
<li>Texas Rangers: mainly to hunt down native populations accused of attacking white settlers</li>

<li>In Ferguson you had a white mayor, white city council, white dominated police force</li>
<li>But in Baltimore you had a Black mayor, majority Black city council, and one of the Blackest police forces in the US</li>

<ul>
<li>60% of incarcerated girls are queer and/or trans</li>
<li>84% of girls in detention have a family history of violence before they are detained</li>
<li>Sexual abuse is one of the main predictors of girls' entry into the juvenile "justice" system, where sexual assault is pervasive in jails and prisons</li>
<li>About 1 in 6 reports lead to arrest; about 1 in 5 arrests are referred to prosectors</li>
<li>Half of prosecutions lead to convictions, vs a much higher general conviction rate</li>
<li>given this record, it's unsurprising that the majority of rapes go unreported</li>

<ul>
<li>"For liberals, police reform is always a question of helping police sustain their legitimacy, despite their illegitimate roots."
<ul>
<li><a href="https://thenewinquiry.com/the-myth-of-liberal-policing/">https://thenewinquiry.com/the-myth-of-liberal-policing/</a></li>

</ul></li>
<li>"An important abolitionist insight is that most prison reforms tend to actually entrench the prison system and expand its reach. 19th century reformers, for instance, created women’s prisons to ameliorate the brutal conditions faced by women who had to share quarters with men in prison. But the result was that exponentially more women were incarcerated."

<p>
"As an abolitionist, who believes that we must create the conditions for dismantling prisons, police, and surveillance,
I’m often asked how to build new institutions that will ensure actual safety.
My answer is always the same: collective organizing.
Currently, there are a range of decarceral/anti-carceral strategies being employed across the country to free prisoners, individually and collectively.
People are organizing for bail reform, taking on individual parole support for prisoners, engaging in court watches, launching mass commutation campaigns,
and advocating for laws that will offer new pathways for release." - <a href="https://thenewinquiry.com/free-us-all/">https://thenewinquiry.com/free-us-all/</a> by Mariame Kaba, aka @prisonculture
